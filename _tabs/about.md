This website was make by Lojayn Khalil to document my work using the cnc machine.

## Goal
The goal of working on this project was to get the cnc machine working and running off of some g-code for cutting out a cube out of a block of wood. To do that I needed a sofware that could similate the job I was creating. I used FreeCAD as it has the ability to simluate the job and the g-code I needed.

## Result
In the end I was able to succesfully able to get the cnc machine working using the g-code I generated using FreeCAD. However, I did not acctualy cut out a cube out of a wood block as the sheild of the cnc machine was broken and it would be dangerous if peices of wood were to go flying. Another factor was that we could see if the g-code was working properly without wasting the wood simply by making the machine run without the wood block.
